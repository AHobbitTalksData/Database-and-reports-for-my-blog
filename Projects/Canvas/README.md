Some of the most important skills in data analysis that cannot be underlooked are creativity and being a good story-teller. Creativity allows to create different stories that, alongside being a good story-teller, can provide sense to the data that is presented. Also, the presentation of the story is important!: is there too much or too little information?, is it aesthetically pleasing?, etc. 

I always have a lot of fun creating these type of projects so please enjoy.
