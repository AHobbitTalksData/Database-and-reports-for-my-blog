In this post I analyze data I abstracted from Google Trends. Specifically, I analyze the popularity from 2004-2023 in USA of key terms that were looked up on Google such as "skincare", "exfoliator", "face cream", "face cleanser" and "sunscreen". 

All the data was cleaned, processed and prepared using Excel and Power Bi. Power Bi Desktop was used for further working on the data and Power Bi Web was used for creating the reports, the dashboards and the app. 

The resulting app can be found here: https://app.powerbi.com/Redirect?action=OpenReport&appId=8d97d782-c4b2-49c6-a95f-7bc93419a986&reportObjectId=c14cc6d7-8cef-4b45-aff2-c257e2da42cb&ctid=e7984cac-2543-4f88-8f97-9524335e6bc4&reportPage=ReportSection&pbi_source=appShareLink. It will ask you to login to the Power Bi website. If you have troubling with permissions after that, please don't hesitate on contacting me.
