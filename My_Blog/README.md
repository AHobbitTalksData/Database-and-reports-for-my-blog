I decided to write this blog because, not only do I want to play with data, but also I want to talk about my findings. 


The format of this directory will be as follows: I will name each subdirectory according to the post for which I used the data documented here and you will be able to find a link to the post in the README file associated to that post. However, not all my posts are going to require being backed up in this repository as some of them will be educational. 

The topics for my posts will be very varied such as the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, beauty, business analysis, music, food or any other topic I might get interested on.
